Public opinion about political leaders often varies widely across different ideological groups.
Using data from the 2020 Cooperative Election Study (CES), which includes responses from thousands of U.S. adults, we explore how political ideology relates to approval of the president.
We model presidential approval as an ordinal function of political ideology and education level using a cumulative logistic regression model.
However, because many CES respondents are part of the YouGov panel, they may not fully represent the broader U.S. population.
People who are very conservative are more likely to approve of the president by about 5.6 points compared to those who are very liberal. We are 95% confident that the true difference lies between 4.9 and 6.2 points.

$$
P(Y \leq k) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left( -\left( \alpha_k - \beta_1 \cdot \text{ideology} - \beta_2 \cdot \text{education} \right) \right)}
$$

$$
Y \sim \text{Ordinal}(\boldsymbol{\rho}) \quad \text{where} \quad \boldsymbol{\rho} = (\rho_1, \rho_2, \ldots, \rho_K)
$$


$$
\begin{aligned}
\log\left[ \frac { P(Y \leq j) }{ 1 - P(Y \leq j) } \right] &= \alpha_j + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_k X_k
